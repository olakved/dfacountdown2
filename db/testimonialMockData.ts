      "My name is Stephanie Agbo, and I am from Enugu, Nigeria. During my final year in the university, just before the coronavirus and world lockdown, I decided to explore Tech. I was looking for opportunities I could learn when I came across the #Digitalforallchallenge on a WhatsApp platform, and it was such a life-changing experience. The curriculum was in-depth, and I learned many skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn't think learning virtually was for me, but it paid off. I'm grateful for this program; it is truly life changing.",

I had a good time working with people from other tracks in the Capstone project, and it made the whole training memorable and different from all other training courses I have attended in the past. I learned excellent skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, C#, ASP.NET, and GIT. I had such a lovely learning experience. I am using the skills learnt during the training in my role at Interswitch.",

The highlight for me was during our career week when we presented the solutions we built. It was indeed an impactful experience. I learned skills like navigating through Linux OS, Kali Linux, Networking, Vulnerability Analysis, Penetration Tests, OWASP Top 10, Acunetix, Nessus, etc. I feel empowered and equipped to pursue a career in Cybersecurity.',

      "My name is Adeoye Folaranmi from Kwara State/Ilorin. Becoming a Product Manager has been a dream I've been chasing. So, when my elder brother shared the link to #Digitalforallchallenge with me, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to learn and apply. The experience was amazing; I learned so much and understood new concepts relating to Product Management. I learned soft skills like empathy, teamwork, collaboration, and effective communication, among others, and software relevant to a Product Manager's success, such as Trello, Jira, Balsamiq Cloud, and Figma, to mention a few. My facilitator was excellent, and I had such a fantastic learning opportunity.",
